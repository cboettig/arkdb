Dear CRAN maintainers,

We are pleased to submit the initial release of arkdb for CRAN. 
This submission ensures that vignettes, tests, and examples only
write to temporary directory, and directory must always be specified
explicitly by the user.


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
